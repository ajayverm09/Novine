      <p>Not all clothes are made the same. Many fast-fashion items may look trendy at first glance but quickly lose shape, color, or stitching quality after a few washes. Knowing how to spot poor-quality clothes will help you save money and build a long-lasting wardrobe.</p>

      <h3>Loose Threads & Weak Stitching</h3>
      <p>Examine the stitching carefully. If you see loose threads, uneven seams, or weak hems, chances are the item won’t last long. Quality brands invest in strong stitching to ensure durability.</p>

      <h3>Fabric That Feels Cheap</h3>
      <p>Touch the fabric. If it feels thin, rough, or plastic-like, it may not stand up to everyday wear. High-quality cotton, linen, silk, or wool have a noticeable difference in touch and durability.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>By learning to recognize the signs of low-quality clothing, you can make smarter shopping decisions and invest in a wardrobe that lasts.</p>

      <p>Every shopper faces this dilemma: should you splurge on that luxury branded jacket, or find a cheaper alternative that still looks good? The answer depends on what you’re buying, your lifestyle, and how often you plan to wear it.</p>

      <h3>When to Splurge</h3>
      <p>Classic pieces like blazers, leather jackets, or premium denim are worth investing in because they last longer and rarely go out of style.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>When to Save</h3>
      <p>Trendy items like graphic tees or seasonal fashion pieces don’t need to break the bank. Affordable brands can offer great style for short-term use.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Spend wisely by splurging on timeless pieces and saving on fast-changing trends.</p>
